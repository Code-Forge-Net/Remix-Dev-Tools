/**
 * @fileoverview SettingsTab component allows you to configure the dev tools right from your browser
 * without having to edit the source code (by directly editing the LocalStorage object). My motive for this was 
 * to make it easier for users to configure the dev tools without having to go through the hassle of editing the source code.
 * 
 * And because Remix Dev Tools is an ever evolving project with more features to come, having a settings tab that's a one-stop for all your
 * configs makes things easier and a better DX in my humble opinion.
