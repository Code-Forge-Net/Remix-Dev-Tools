# Plugins

This folder contains all the ready to go plugins that you can copy/paste into your project.

If you build a plugin please feel free to create a PR towards the `plugins` folder so we can add it to the list of plugins.

## How to use

Each plugin has a `README.md` file that explains how to use it.


So all you need to do is find the one you like, copy the code and paste it into your project and follow the instructions from the `README.md` file.

## Can I add my own features?

All the plugins featured under this folder are meant to be copy/pasted into your project with you having all the rights to modify them as you see fit. Feel free to add/remove whatever you like. If you add something cool, please share it with us so we can add it to the list of plugins or improve the existing ones.

## How to add a new plugin

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new folder under `plugins` with the name of your plugin
3. Add a `README.md` file with the instructions on how to use the plugin
4. Add TODO's in the code where the user needs to modify the code to their project specifications
5. Add an image/video/gif of the plugin in action
